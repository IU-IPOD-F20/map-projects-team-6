# MAP-F20-template

This is a repo for MAP course project.

# Project description:

With the advent of the pandemic, the educational process went online. The organization of tests and controls has become more complicated: proctoring systems, entering handwritten tasks into the text field for answers, difficulties in combining the test task on the screen, the proctoring window and the solution field.

The idea of the project is to create an application that solves the above problems (for example, allows you to upload photos of written answers) and eliminates the stress of students and teachers during the organization of the test.
