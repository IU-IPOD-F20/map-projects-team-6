# QUIZ project

This is a repo for MAP course project.

# Project description:

With the advent of the pandemic, the educational process went online. The organization of tests and controls has become more complicated: proctoring systems, entering handwritten tasks into the text field for answers, difficulties in combining the test task on the screen, the proctoring window and the solution field.

The idea of the project is to create an application that solves the above problems (for example, allows you to upload photos of written answers) and eliminates the stress of students and teachers during the organization of the test.

## Sprint 0 results:

In this sprint, we initialized the project and received recommendations for future improvement of the project. In particular, we decided to use milestones and improved the project description. The standart scheme of sprint procedures(planning meetings, sprint reviews, branching convention) were established. "Must" user stories were created.

## Sprint 1 results:

In this sprint, we made the first successful commits and received recommendations for improving the project. In particular, we decided to change a branching policy and use a special naming of the branches and created a Wiki page for our project. Also, unfortunately, not everything planned was done on time.

## Sprint 2 results:

In this sprint, we have significantly expanded the functionality of our project and completed the tasks of the last sprint. This time, the recommendation included a requirement to add tests and figure out how tasks and user stories are connected. Faced with a problem of unambiguous linking User Stories to issues( left it to next sprint).

## Sprint 3 results:

In this sprint, we paid a lot of attention to the functionality and documentation. The main recommendation after the sprint was the addition of CI testing. The prviously mentioned problem of linking US to issues was processed and solved. User Stories updated and extended with "could" and "should" features.
